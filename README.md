## Installation and how to use
The project can be obtained by either downloading directly via this GitHub repo or cloned by running the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/csdoris/Group-7-Kimchi-Stonks.git`

It is required that [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed before running the following commands.

#### Firstly, we want to navigate into the backend folder to perform a clean install of our dependencies and start it up.

```
$ cd Group-7-Kimchi-Stonks/
$ cd backend/
$ npm ci
added XXX packages in Xs
$ npm start
```

#### We should expect this message in whatever terminal is being used:

```
[nodemon] 2.0.7
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node src/server.js`
Server currently listening to http://localhost:8080
Connection to MongoDB successful.
```

#### Next we will do the same in the frontend folder

```
$ cd frontend/
$ npm ci
added XXX packages in Xs
$ npm start
```

#### And we expect this message:

```
Compiled successfully!
